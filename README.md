Explanation:
To create these logo I have used SVG which is (Scalable Vector Graphics) it is a powerful XML-based markup language used to describe two-dimensional vector graphics. 
It's widely used in web development for creating interactive and responsive graphical elements.

<svg> Begins the SVG element.
width="400" height="400": Sets the width and height of the SVG canvas to 400x400 pixels.
viewBox="0 0 200 200": Defines the coordinate system and aspect ratio .

<g transform="rotate(45 100 100)">: Groups the SVG elements and applies a rotation to it.

These <rect> elements represent colored rectangles inside the rotated group 
x, y, width, height, and fill attributes specify position, dimensions, and color of the diamond shape.
